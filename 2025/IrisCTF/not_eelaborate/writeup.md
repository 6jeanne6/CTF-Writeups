# IrisCTF2025 - Not Eelaborate

OSINT - Easy - 50 points

## Challenge description

*After my long train ride, I visited a deer park and got to feed the wildlife. There were so many restaurants to choose from but I was craving eel. I really like the soup mixed in with the rice and fish. The wasabi threw me off since I don’t normally have it served this way.*

*I would recommend this place if you want to find a quiet restaurant to eat at, and wouldn’t mind finding a few small fish bones. Eels are known to carry lots of tiny bones it’s inevitable that you’ll find it in a lot of places.*

*Question: What is the full name of the restaurant?*

## Solution

Adam is still in Japan, and so one of the most famous deer park is the Nara Park.

Searching for unagi restaurants around the park, I checked photos of each restaurant. Edogawa Kintetsu Nara has a similar meal tray, especially with red cutlery and teapot.

The flag is: `irisctf{Edogawa_Kintetsu_Nara}`
